# **Instagram Follower Comparison Tool**

This is a simple, single-file HTML application designed to compare your Instagram "followers" and "following" lists.  
It helps you quickly find out who isn't following you back and which accounts you don't follow back.

## **Features**

* **Find Unfollowers:** See a list of people you follow who do not follow you back.  
* **Find Fans:** See a list of people who follow you that you do not follow back.  
* **Total Counts:** Displays the total number of accounts you are following and the total number of followers you have.  
* **Privacy-Focused:** This tool runs entirely in your web browser. Your data is not uploaded to any server.  
* **Easy to Use:** Just upload your two JSON files and click "Compare."

## **How to Use**

1. **Get Your Data from Instagram:**  
   * Go to your Instagram profile \> Settings \> Your information and permissions \> Download your information.  
   * Request a download (you will need the JSON format, not HTML).  
   * This may take some time. Instagram will email you a link when your data is ready.  
   * Download and unzip the file.  
2. **Find the Correct Files:**  
   * Inside the unzipped folder, navigate to followers\_and\_following.  
   * You will need these two files:

     * following.json  
3. **Use the Tool:**

   * Click the "Upload followers.json" button and select your followers.json file.  
   * Click the "Compare Lists" button.
